All these repositories is used in the paper titled with 'Variational autoencoder for semi-supervised text classification'

data: all data files is kept in this directory, including data, word embeddings, pretrained_weights.
results: the directory where the resulting models are saved.
auxiliary_vae and avae_fix: the model that uses the auxiliary variable in the VAE, this can produce good results. They differs in whether fixing the latent variable in generation.
SemiSample... I don't know which one is used in the paper and I am verifying this. It seems that SemiSample-S2 is the latest version.
